class fdict(dict):
    '''
    Flattened nested dict, all items are settable and gettable through ['item1']['item2'] standard form or ['item1/item2'] internal form.
    This allows to replace the internal dict with any on-disk storage system like a shelve's shelf (great for huge nested dicts that cannot fit into memory).
    Main limitation: an entry can be both a singleton and a nested fdict: when an item is a singleton, you can setitem to replace to a nested dict, but if it is a nested dict and you setitem it to a singleton, both will coexist. Except for fastview mode, there is no way to know if a nested dict exists unless you walk through all items, which would be too consuming for a simple setitem. In this case, a getitem will always return the singleton, but nested leaves can always be accessed via items() or by direct access (eg, x['a/b/c']).

    Fastview mode: remove conflicts issue and allow for fast O(m) contains(), delete() and view*() (such as vieitems()) where m in the number of subitems, instead of O(n) where n was the total number of elements in the fdict(). Downside is setitem() being O(m) too because of nodes metadata building, and memory/storage overhead, since we store all nodes and leaves lists in order to allow for fast lookup.

        Parameters
        ----------
        d  : dict, optional
            Initialize with a pre-existing dict.
            Also used internally to pass a reference to parent fdict.
        rootpath : str, optional
            Internal variable, define the nested level.
        delimiter  : str, optional
            Internal delimiter for nested levels. Can also be used for
            getitem direct access (e.g. ``x['a/b/c']``).
            [default : '/']
        fastview  : bool, optional
            Activates fastview mode, which makes setitem slower
            in O(m*l) instead of O(1), but makes view* methods
            (viewitem, viewkeys, viewvalues) as fast as dict's.
            [default : False]
        nodel  : bool, optional
            Activates nodel mode, which makes contains test
            in O(1) for nodes (leaf test is always O(1) in any mode).
            Only drawback: delitem is not suppressed.
            Useful for quick building of databases, then you can
            reopen the database with a normal fdict if you want
            the ability to delitem.
            [default : False]
        Returns
        -------
        out  : dict-like object.

        '''
        Parameters
        ----------
        d  : dict, optional
            Initialize with a pre-existing dict.
            Also used internally to pass a reference to parent fdict.
        rootpath : str, optional
            Internal variable, define the nested level.
        delimiter  : str, optional
            Internal delimiter for nested levels. Can also be used for
            getitem direct access (e.g. ``x['a/b/c']``).
            [default : '/']
        fastview  : bool, optional
            Activates fastview mode, which makes setitem slower
            in O(m*l) instead of O(1), but makes view* methods
            (viewitem, viewkeys, viewvalues) as fast as dict's.
            [default : False]
        nodel  : bool, optional
            Activates nodel mode, which makes contains test
            in O(1) for nodes (leaf test is always O(1) in any mode).
            Only drawback: delitem is not suppressed.
            Useful for quick building of databases, then you can
            reopen the database with a normal fdict if you want
            the ability to delitem.
            [default : False]
        filename : str, optional
            Path and filename where to store the database.
            [default : random temporary file]
        autosync : bool, optional
            Commit (sync) to file at every setitem (assignment).
            Assignments are always stored on-disk asap, but not
            changes to non-dict collections stored in leaves
            (e.g. updating a list stored in a leaf will not commit to disk).
            This option allows to sync at the next assignment automatically
            (because there is no way to know if a leaf collection changed).
            Drawback: if you do a lot of assignments, this will significantly
            slow down your processing, so it is advised to rather sync()
            manually at regular intervals.
            [default : False]
        writeback : bool, optional
            Activates shelve writeback option. If False, only assignments
            will allow committing changes of leaf collections. See shelve
            documentation. Will be disabled if readonly is True (necessary otherwise
            exception when calling close()).
            [default : True]
        forcedumbdbm : bool, optional
            Force the use of the Dumb DBM implementation to manage
            the on-disk database (should not be used unless you get an
            exception because not any other implementation of anydbm
            can be found on your system). Dumb DBM should work on
            any platform, it is native to Python.
            [default : False]
        readonly : bool, optional
            Open the database as read-only. This is necessary for some tests
            to check the internal state of a stored database beyond the autosync
            process.
            [default : False]
